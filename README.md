# Computer-Vision-Brain-MRI-Metastasis-Segmentation-Assignment
The "Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation Assignment" employs computer vision techniques to segment metastatic tumors in MRI images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project focuses on enhancing tumor detection accuracy while reducing analysis time through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
